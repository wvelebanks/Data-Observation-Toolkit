The quickest way to start using DOT is by utilizing the provided Docker environment and demo data. If you've already installed the required software (as per the general prerequisites), follow these steps:
1.	Download or clone the DOT repository to your computer.
2.	Start Docker.
3.	Open a terminal and navigate to the docker folder inside your DOT installation directory:

      - **For Windows:**
       ```bash
        cd C:<PATH_TO_DOT>\Data-Observation-Toolkit\docker
       ```
     - **For Mac/Linux:**
       ```bash
        cd <PATH_TO_DOT>/Data-Observation-Toolkit/docker/
       ```
4.	On Mac/Linux, run python3 run_demo.py. On Windows, run python3 .\run_demo.py.
5.	The script will launch DOT and open a browser window with the [DOT User Interface](http://localhost:82/app/data-observation-toolkit/run-log-634491ea0da61b0e9f38760d?embed=True). Refer to the demo video above for a step-by-step guide.
6.	When you're finished with the demo, press **Return** in the terminal to stop the Docker containers.
