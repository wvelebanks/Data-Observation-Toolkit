# Deploying DOT to Airflow
This setup serves as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how Airflow can be configured to run DOT across multiple databases. It is designed to copy data from the **data** database back into the **DOT** database. In a production environment, the flow would instead transfer data from the source production database into the data_ schema of the DOT database. This configuration assumes you have already completed the Docker environment setup, as outlined in the previous section.

## Configuring/Building Airflow Docker environment

#### ðŸŒŸ Optional but Highly Recommended ðŸŒŸ

If you wish to include the user interface (UI) while building the containers for DOT, you will need to add the following code snippet. This snippet can be found in the `docker-compose.yml` file, specifically on lines 31-38. Copy the code and insert it into the `docker-compose-with-airflow.yml` file, ensuring that the code is placed below line 92. Make sure to maintain the proper indentation.

```yaml
appsmith:
  image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
  container_name: appsmith
  ports:
    - "82:80"
    - "446:443"
  volumes:
    - ./appsmith/stacks:/appsmith-stacks
```
Additionally, in the docker-compose-with-airflow.yml file, remove line 61 as it is redundant. Set the configuration AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES to False as shown below:
```yaml
AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES: 'False'
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Set Up Airflow and Run DOT with Docker
1. Navigate to the Docker directory:
   ```bash
   cd ./docker
   ```
2. Set the PostgreSQL password environment variable:
  ```bash
  export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<THE PASSWORD YOU USED WHEN BUILDING DOT>
  ```
  Replace <THE PASSWORD YOU USED WHEN BUILDING DOT> with the actual password.

3.  Build the Docker containers using ```docker-compose-with-airflow.yml```:
   ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose-with-airflow.yml build
   ```
  _**Note** in case you get an error related to ssh-agent, be sure to use the following:_
      ```eval $(ssh-agent)  ==> for windows users   Or   eval ssh-agent  ==> for Mac/Linux users
      ```
4.  Initialize the Airflow containers:
   ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose-with-airflow.yml up airflow-init
   ```
5.  Start the containers in detached mode:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-with-airflow.yml up -d
   ```
6.  Access the Airflow worker container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it docker-airflow-worker-1 /bin/bash
   ```
7.  Navigate to the dot directory and run the installation script:
   ```bash
    cd /app/dot && ./install_dot.sh
   ```

These steps will build and initialize your Docker containers, set up Airflow, and install DOT in the appropriate environment.

**Notes:**
- Make sure to replace `<THE PASSWORD YOU USED WHEN BUILDING DOT>` with the actual password used during setup.
- If you face any issues with the container names (like `docker-airflow-worker-1`), check the container name using the `docker ps` command to confirm the exact name.
-  _**If using Docker on AWS, you might need to use docker-compose instead of docker compose.**_


## Airflow Docker Environment Management
You might need to use `docker-compose` on some hosts.

**Starting Airflow Docker Environment**
To start the Airflow Docker environment in detached mode, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-with-airflow.yml up -d
```
**Stopping Airflow Docker Environment**

To stop the Airflow Docker containers, run:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-with-airflow.yml stop
```

**Removing Airflow Docker Environment**

To remove the Airflow Docker environment and its associated volumes, run:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-with-airflow.yml down -v
```
This will remove the containers and any volumes defined in the docker-compose-with-airflow.yml file, ensuring a clean environment.

## Running DOT in Airflow (Demo)

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is included that copies data from the uploaded DB dump into the DOT database (```data_ScanProject1``` schema) and then runs the toolkit against this data. Follow these steps to execute the DAG:

- Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8083/](http://localhost:8083/).
- Log in with the credentials: 'airflow' / 'airflow'. as shown below:

   <figure style="text-align:center;">

      <img src="https://github.com/wvelebanks/Data-Observation-Toolkit/blob/f3759185cdec418275d1f7c84114234e1aa5d27b/images/airflow_lgin.png" alt="dot_acrh" />
   </figure>

- In the top menu, click on DAGs on the top menu, you should see a detail view panel for the Dags as shown below:
   <figure style="text-align:center;">

      <img src="https://github.com/wvelebanks/Data-Observation-Toolkit/blob/f3759185cdec418275d1f7c84114234e1aa5d27b/images/airflow_interface.png" alt="dot_acrh" />
   </figure>

- Use the search box in the top-right corner to search for dot (press Enter twice to ensure it registers).
- Toggle the ```run_dot_project``` DAG to Active (using the toggle on the far left of the row).

   </figure>

- Click the Play icon under Actions to start the run.

To monitor the progress and view logs:

- Click on one of the status circles under Runs (e.g., running or completed).
- Click on the top Dag Id.
- Select a task and then click Log to view the logs.

To debug a task using the Airflow CLI (e.g., if you encounter the object ```ancview_danger_sign error```):
Open a terminal and execute the following command to access the Airflow worker container:
```bash
docker exec -it docker-airflow-worker-1 /bin/bash
```
Run the following Airflow command to test the task:
```bash
airflow tasks test run_dot_project sync_object_flight_data 2022-03-01
```
To run just the DOT stage:
```bash
airflow tasks test run_dot_project run_dot 2022-03-01
```
